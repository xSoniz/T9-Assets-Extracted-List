This Github aims to share with you the Assets extracted from the T9 engine (Call of Duty Cold War).  

You should know that the values of the Assets of the T9 engine (Call of Duty Cold War) are hashed using the FNV1a64 hashing process.  
All the strings are currently hashed via FNV1a64, you can nevertheless replace the hash via a library which would contain the non-hashed strings.  

It is impossible to reverse the FNV1a64 process.  
Currently I only share with you the Assets Type "StringTable" that I quickly extracted a few weeks ago.  

I'll update the GitHub as the mood takes me.  

GitHub Created for educational purposes.
